        <h5>About the product</h5>
        <p>The Crescent bed is at once sophisticated
             and soothing with its minimal lines and 
             dark metal legs. Supported by a solid birch
             frame and solidified with plywood reinforcements,
             the Crescent bed is cushioned with dense
             polyurethane foam and covered with a fabric 
             lining.
